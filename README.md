### CPSC 120

*I like [Lab 7](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-07-juan-and-partner) part 2 because it was the lab that I actually finished on time before the class had ended. I was able to successfully use function to create a black jack game no matter how many wrong inserts or values were given. It was really fun to actually know how this card game actually worked it was a lot of fun.

*One of my favourite labs was [lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-12-juan-and-david) part 1 because me and my partner had been having trouble doing the few past labs but this time we did it. We were able to use everything we have learned to create a cool image. 

*n [Lab 5](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-05-alec-m-and-juan-a), Part 2, was another lab that I really enjoyed doing becase we to created a program to find the average. It was intesring how to understand the how Doubles and floats work in order to make things more accurate.
